# Image_Pyramid
Python code for generating Gaussian pyramids and Laplacian pyramids for different levels and concatenate the images for displaying the pyramids. 
Currently, there are available functions for displaying the pyramid images this way in OpenCV Which can improve the working of the code for better result.
